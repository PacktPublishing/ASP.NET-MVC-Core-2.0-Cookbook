## About the Book
The ASP.Net Core 2.0 Framework is designed to meet the needs of today's web developers. It provides better control, support for test-driven development, and cleaner code. Moreover, it's lightweight and allows you to run apps on OSX and Linux, making it the most popular web framework with modern day developers.

This book follows a unique approach to web development, using real-world examples that guide you through problems with ASP.Net Core web applications. It covers VS2017 and ASP.Net Core 2.0-specific changes and provides general MVC development recipes. Learn to set up .Net Core, Visual Studio 2017, NodeJs Modules, and NuGet, and work with IoC data and caching. We will explore every day ASP.NET MVC patterns and go beyond ASP.NET MVC into troubleshooting. Finally, we will lead you through migrating, hosting, and deploying your code.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
public class Person
{
    public class Name {get;set;}
    public Person(){
        Name = "Stephane";
    }
}
```

It's beneficial to have some web backend or frontend programming experience.

You'll need Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio Code, Atom, SQL Server Management Studio, and a modern web browser installed. Don't worry, we'll guide you on how to install them when needed.

You'll need an active Azure subscription. The Microsoft Azure platform offers free trial accounts at http://www.azure.com
